Most feel homesick in the first few weeks when they are adjusting to being away from home. Many students struggle to find where they belong on a large campus like the one here in Madison. “The beginning of the semester was really tough. I cried in the bathroom at the first football game because I missed home so much,” said freshman Grace Wright.</p>
                                                                            <p>The midpoint of the semester is often when many first-year students feel overwhelmed and eager to visit home. After the exciting events of Family Weekend, many freshmen feel as though the end of the semester is nowhere in sight. “My parents and sister came this week- end and saying goodbye was really tough,” said freshman Michaela Baldwin. “Saying goodbye felt like the first time again.”</p>
                                                                            <p>Experts say that the best way to combat homesickness is to create a family of friends. Getting involved in clubs and activities can also ease the transition by creating a routine and habits. It's easy for freshmen to believe that a visit home will ease their feelings of sadness but college counselors warn that this can just delay acclimating to living away from home. A focus on new friends and work can bridge the four weeks till Thanksgiving break.</p>

With the help of the sharks, West is studying drug delivery mechanisms for cancer. “We can use these shark antibodies to help traffic these drugs to the tumor and less of it into the body so

Other events featured were Cocoa with HoCo and the UW Homecoming Blood Drive. Another spectacular sight was Fill the Hill, which has been a tradition for more than 40 years. Starting on Thursday, Bascom Hill became covered with plastic pink flamingos. For 24 hours, every gift made in support of UW-Madison added one more bird to the flock, transforming the hill into a pink frenzy.</p><p>The party continued Friday with the Homecoming Parade, another cherished tradition that celebrated the vibrant student life at UW. The parade made its way down State Street, and ended on Lake Street around 7:30pm. Spectators listened to the UW Marching Band, watched floats of student groups, and cheered on Bucky Badger as they showed off their school spirit.</p><p>Wynton Wright, president of the Wisconsin Homecoming Committee, says that he looks forward to the parade every year. “This is an amazing culmination of all the work the Committee puts together throughout the week, and it really brings the campus community together,” Wynton said. “In addition to this, we have a returning tradition of the Game Night this year, which we are very excited about. Having something for every- one during Homecoming Week is our continued goal.”</p><p>There truly was something for everyone at the Block Party and Pep Rally, which featured a silent disco in Alumni Park, stargazing with telescopes, Wisco bingo, and performances by Fundamentally Sound, Wild Rumpus Circuits, and Optima Dance. The Multicultural Homecoming Yard Show was also a huge hit, with dance and comedy routines that showcased a celebration of culture. Alumni and students alike hosted networking events and a welcome reception. “Something that is unique to UW-Madison's Homecoming is how accessible our events and committee are,” Wright added.</p><p>Homecoming events culminated on Saturday with tailgates and <span style="line-height: 16px;">watch parties for the Wisconsin vs. Penn State game. The packed student section in the epitome of badger pride sang renditions of “Build Me Up Buttercup” and “Varsity” which echoed across the stands. Students remained to see the game until its very end, despite Wisconsin’s 28-13 loss.</span></p>

Wisconsin Racing representatives Isabella Nedland, Julian Ildau-Tarmo and Lillian Zahn appeared in front of the Committee Thursday, October 17th, to present their budget proposal. Wisconsin Racing is UW-Madison’s Formula SAE Team and each year designs and builds two cars, one electric, and one combustion, in order to represent Badgers and compete against other teams from across the world.</p>
                                                                                           <p>Leading up to the contentious vote on Monday, representatives in SSFC, a student government body respon- sible for allocating over one million dollars of student segregated fees to student organizations, disagreed on the eligibility of Wisconsin Racing for funding. At question was whether Wisconsin Racing offered a service that was available to students upon request. Ildau-Tarmo clarified that as long as there is no legal boundary, such as required training before using welding equipment, students can request to be put on any project that they find interesting. Nedland gave examples including that of her own experi- ence in which students could join and quickly become involved in various hands-on projects even if they had limited experience or knowledge in those areas. After prolonged debate, four representa- tives remained unconvinced, and the group was voted eligible by a margin of one vote.</p>
                                                                                            <p>Wisconsin Racing proceeded to be allocated $165,334.91 in funding, including $100,852.48 for supplies and $50,462.44 for travel. The budget, the largest approved so far this year, was unusual since it was the first to not request salaries for students involved in the organi- zation. Not including Wisconsin Racing’s allocation, $273,773.25 of $378,026 allocated (just over 72% of all the money allocated so far this year) has been for the salaries of student organization leaders. In total, seven groups have been allocated a combined $543,360.91.</p>

<div class="sect" style="text-transform: uppercase;">What Happens When We Stop Talking</div>
<p>Communication is arguably the most powerful weapon we wield as human beings. This universal skill allows us to express our thoughts, feelings, and ideas with our peers while also strengthening connections with friends and family members. This exchange of both accepted and controversial opinions is a crucial part of our society, as difficult conversations are often what results in compromise and understanding.</p>
<p>Today, there is a great divide between individuals with conflicting mindsets, arguably greater than ever. In more recent years, the segregation of those with opposing opinions has resulted in a lack of communication regarding difficult subject matter, with a primary example being politics. The resentment towards those on the converse side of the political spectrum is so strong in recent years, that it’s difficult to recognize our peers with clashing mindsets as fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Our stances on challenging topics are what humanizes us. Our thoughts and emotions result from where we have been, how we’ve been raised, and reflect where we plan to go in our lives. We don’t sit around and construct opinions solely to anger our peers. Every human experience is unique, directly resulting in various takes on complex topics.</p>
<p>Growing up in New York, I have observed a growing divide between people of the Democrat and Republican parties. In the most recent debate, the blatant disrespect each candidate gave the other was striking to me. I asked myself, “Have debates always been this way?” The answer is a definite no. I researched past presidential debates and one that struck me was the 1960 debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. This debate demonstrates how far we have strayed from civilized, respectful human interaction. The candidates are often complimentary of one another and respectfully converse despite representing opposite sides of the political spectrum. This behavior strays so far from this year's presidential debates where there was a lot of bitterness.</p>
<p>I believe our willingness to converse as a society has been narrowed, and I feel the primary cause of this is fear. As a community, I feel we are afraid of having our opinions mocked, posted online, or gossiped about. It is difficult to thoroughly express one's school of thought without fear of being attacked by others of a different mindset. By the same token, we are afraid to hurt other people's feelings. I am proposing civilized, respectful conversation we can speak our mind and listen to each other.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable topics are common in politics. Does this mean we shouldn’t talk about them? Of course not! These disagreeable matters are essential to discuss because they affect American citizens. If we stop talking, new feats as a nation will be hard to achieve. Practicing civil debate makes it hard to demonize others who think differently from us, strengthening us to keep our sense of humanity. We need to keep talking, lest we become an entirely segregated society, unable to act civilly.</p>

<div class="sect" style="text-transform: uppercase;">Saturday Mornings on the Square</div>
<p>Saturday morning in Madison is incomplete without a visit to the Dane County Farmers’ Market. Spanning from April 13 to November 9, the market is a key component of the week for many families and students.</p>
<p>The past Saturdays have been filled with buzz as locals and students soak up the last weekends of warmth. Surrounded by the fall colors, the market spills down State Street, and forms a complete square around the Capitol, boasting over 150 vendors. The vendors create a warm sense of community and welcome. You can find fresh squeaky cheese curds, red radishes making for a delicious meal, or a fresh bouquet ready to blossom.</p>
<p>Possibly the most beautiful part of the market is the community it fosters. Whether you are a brand new freshman, like myself, or a family in Madison, the outing creates bonds. Being a student, I often find my peers searching for a group to attend with. Last weekend, I woke up on a sunny, autumn morning excited to meet up with my friends and walk to the market. We stopped on the corner of State and North Carroll to pick up our favorite bakery treat &mdash; cinnamon rolls. The local stand sells out every Saturday, and has developed loyal customers. Take it from me, and microwave your cinnamon rolls for 30 seconds, and then dig in. It makes the sweetness of your Saturday last the whole week! When you stroll to the next street of vendors, look out for honey. Looking to recover from the common fall cold, clover honey did the trick. Mixed in tea, the honey added the perfect, natural sweetness.</p>
<p>After you meander around the market, you must wrap up your morning by getting a bagel. Whether you are partial to a New York style bagel or new to the bagel connoisseur family, you can find many fresh, filling bagels on your way back from the capitol. My personal favorite is the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese!</p>
<p>From students to families, the Dane County Farmers’ Market is the perfect place to enjoy a Saturday morning, and the city of Madison would not be complete without it.</p>

We, nevertheless, enter- tain very sanguine hopes that the plan on which this paper will be conducted will garner public favor.</p><p>Local newspapers can both waylay corruption through investigation and be springs of joy by capturing moments in peoples lives, from a science fair to a wedding. Articles create transparent communities where voters became informed, national events are contextualized, and local issues stand trial.</p><p>It is very far from our intention to detract from the merits of the newspapers now in existence. But it is also true the policies of the present established papers have deprived readers of many of the advantages which traditionally resulted from reading the paper.</p><p>As long as it remains justified to do so, T<span style="font-size: 12px">HE</span> M<span style="font-size: 12px">ESSENGER</span> will be free. Display advertisements by local firms that meet our standards of integrity and quality will be run throughout the paper, so that readers have reason to trust the entirety of what is in the paper and not just what is in our news columns. We will establish a class- ified advertisement section so that readers can easily buy, sell, and rent what they need from each other, secure jobs, capture life's special moments, and do so much more. Our reporting will be principled upon accuracy, reliability, simplicity, and impartiality using language that is parliamentary in good society.</p><p>Of course, some time is necessary to get the machinery in working order and to build. We hope, however, at the very outset to show that we are disposed, and in time that we are able, to make as good a newspaper in all respects, and in many a much better one, than those hitherto offered.</p><p>We know how much easier it is to say this than it is to do it; but we hope to show in due course that we have not failed in our promise or disappointed any just expectation. We shall seldom trouble our readers with our personal affairs; but these few words, at the outset, seemed called for and needed.</p>

In the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, Bacon finished in fifth place, and has only gotten better since then, including <span style="line-height: 16px;">winning the 200 meter backstroke at the NCAA Championship meet in March of this year for UW-Madison.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 16px;">Making it to the Olympic finals, Bacon entered as the top seeded swimmer, with a semifinals time of 2:07.32. However, Bacon faced some disappointment, as she missed out on the podium by only 4/100ths of a second. Kaylee Mckeown of Australia won gold, Regan Smith of U.S.A earned silver, and Kylie Masse of Canada beat out Bacon for bronze. She was the only Badger swimmer to make the U.S. Olympic team and has her sights set on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.</p>

Each one is of a duck. Some show ducks flying — mergan- sers, pintails, mallards and elders. Some show ducks swimming. One shows a dog with a duck in its mouth. The portraits of the ducks (and that retriever) were drawn or painted for stamps. Not postage stamps, but federal duck stamps that hunters who want to shoot waterfowl are required to buy along with their state licenses. The revenue goes toward buying acreage for wildlife habitats.

The 50-kilo bags were stamped USAID – short for the U.S. Agency for International Development, the world’s largest donor of food assistance. The grain was supposed to help some of the millions of people in Tigray who depend on food donations to survive. But instead of heading to its intended destination &mdash; a camp filled with starving people &mdash; the red truck was moving in the wrong direction.</p>

The US’s enemies never broke the code before their defeat.</p><p>Kinsel enlisted with the US marines in 1942, serving in their ninth regiment and third division during the battle of Iwo Jima against Japan. The code whose development Kinsel aided played a vital role in ensuring the security of operations that the American military conducted during campaigns in Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal and Okinawa, said a Navajo nation news release announcing his death.<p>He told the Guardian in 2015 that for decades no one knew what his assignment had been during his service with the marines. “Not even the Navajo nation knew,” Kinsel said</p>

A short distance away I can see the rim of the volcano's crater lake, while to the south steam vents and mud pools bubble away. Krafla has erupted around 30 times in the last 1,000 years, and most recently in the mid-1980s. Bjorn Guðmundsson leads me to a grassy hillside. He is running a team of international scientists who plan to drill into Krafla's magma. “We’re standing on</p>

It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys.</p><p style="text-align-last: justify;">Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life, making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for it. Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors. Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions. SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile) journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated from the upper stage, floated off and called home. “Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,”</p>
